## Gate-Checker

**Gate-Checker** is a powerful Web3 application designed to streamline and enhance access management for blockchain-enabled platforms. It provides a robust, user-friendly solution for verifying user eligibility and permissions based on blockchain assets, roles, or criteria such as token ownership or smart contract interactions.

### Key Use Case: Workshop Access Verification
