## Summary

### Gate-checker

Gate-checker is a powerful Web3 application designed to streamline and enhance access management for blockchain-enabled platforms. It provides a robust, user-friendly solution for verifying user eligibility and permissions based on blockchain assets, roles, or criteria such as token ownership or smart contract interactions.

One of the main use cases:

-Workshops creators and/or organisers would like to verify that participants have the necessary permissions to participate in their workshops. This can be achieved by checking if the participants have the required NFT in order to access. In order to get the corresponding NFT, participants need to complete a specific task or action on the platform. This ensures that only authorized participants can access the workshop.
